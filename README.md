# Python-project
 Maxwell–Boltzmann Speed Explorer
------------------
A Python-based interactive simulator that visualizes and analyzes the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in ideal gases like nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂). Designed with educational and scientific exploration in mind, this tool allows users to input temperature and molar amounts and get insightful physical data — all through a colorful, user-friendly console interface.

🚀 Features
📈 Distribution Plotting: Draw the speed distribution of gas molecules at a given temperature.

🧮 Probability Calculation: Compute the probability that a randomly chosen molecule's speed falls within a specific interval.

🎯 Most Probable Speed: Instantly get the speed value at which the distribution peaks.

💬 Interactive CLI Menu: Fully guided menu with colorful prompts and error-handling.

🧠 Input Validation: Built-in user feedback for incorrect data formats, out-of-range values, and unrealistic parameters.

💻 Custom ASCII Art: Styled headers for a fun, retro-lab experience.
